## Getting Started

This project contains a terminal `TicTacToe` game. You play against an 
ai, which uses the minimax algorithm to make a move.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the folder with compiled output files 


> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
