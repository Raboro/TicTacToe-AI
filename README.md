## Getting Started

This project contains a terminal [TicTacToe] game. You play against an 
ai, which uses the [Minimax-Algorithmus] to make a move.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    > is seperated in two folders:
    > - `Tests`
    > - `TicTacToeAI`
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the folder with compiled output files 


> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
